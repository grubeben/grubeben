# Servus or Hey there!

Welcome to my Github ‚ú®
I am about to finish my masters degree in CSE (Computational Science and Engineering) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) in Vienna, Austria. My B.Sc was in Mechanical Engineering and Management, also at TU Wien - I was part of exchange programs to [ETH Z√ºrich](https://www.ethz.ch/), [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/) and most recently a visiting researcher at the [University of California - Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) for my M.Sc thesis. 

Best way to reach out to me would be at [/in/grubeben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-gruber-4817781a1/), even though I am not on the platform regularly.

Most of my university projects are in private repos, but some are available here (_or somewhat available_ üç≥).

## üì¶ [XXXX]((https://github.com/grubeben/grubeben) üì¶
Working together with a fintech firm and three classmates we looked into the possibility of using Machine Learning to speed up their operations. The team within the firm we were working with had one main task: solving a constrained non-linear optimization problem using an evolutionary optimization algorithm called CMA-ES. However, there was one problem, deciding upon the feasibility of the solutions the algorithm suggested was computationally heavy. Our task was thus to see if Machine Learning could be used to filter out infeasible solutions. We took an explorative approach, testing a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms, supervised as well as unsupervised. Unfortunetaly, not method yielded useful results. We thinks this is mainly due to the evolutionary algorithm advancing towards the optimum in iterational steps through the large feature space (~4000 dimensions), which means that the classifiers needs to extrapolate.

_Below follows a gif of how the CMA-ES moves during its first 100 iterations, projected down to 3 dimensions using PCA._

My most interesting work is in the field of **Topological Data Analysis**.
My B.Sc thesis in Applied Mathematics was done at the University of Nairobi and Uber Technologies in Kenya.

You'll also find a project on financial modelling using Python. The project is in the form of a workbook using Colab/Jupyter Notebook teaching the reader how to download financial data, model financial claims and calculating volatilities (implied and historical). Unfortunely (?), it is only available for the Swedish speaker...
