# Servus or Hey there!

Welcome to my Github ✨
I am about to finish my masters degree in CSE (Computational Science and Engineering) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) in Vienna, Austria. My B.Sc was in Mechanical Engineering and Management, also at TU Wien - I was part of exchange programs to [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/), [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/) and most recently a visiting researcher at the [University of California - Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) for my M.Sc thesis. 

Best way to reach out to me would be at [/in/grubeben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-gruber-4817781a1/), even though I am not on the platform regularly.

Most of my university projects are in private repos, but some are available here (_or somewhat available_ 🍳).

##  [Applied Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/grubeben/) 📦

You can find the thesis here and a short video presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEv1J6oSts).

My most interesting work is in the field of **Topological Data Analysis**.
My B.Sc thesis in Applied Mathematics was done at the University of Nairobi and Uber Technologies in Kenya.

## 📈[Osäker osäkerhet](https://github.com/EricBojs/Osaker-osakerhet)📈
You'll also find a project on financial modelling using Python. The project is in the form of a workbook using Colab/Jupyter Notebook teaching the reader how to download financial data, model financial claims and calculating volatilities (implied and historical). Unfortunely (?), it is only available for the Swedish speaker...
